# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow will build, test, sign and package a WPF or Windows Forms desktop application
# built on .NET Core.
# To learn how to migrate your existing application to .NET Core,
# refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop-wpf/migration/convert-project-from-net-framework
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Configure environment variables
# GitHub sets default environment variables for every workflow run.
# Replace the variables relative to your project in the "env" section below.
#
# 2. Signing
# Generate a signing certificate in the Windows Application
# Packaging Project or add an existing signing certificate to the project.
# Next, use PowerShell to encode the .pfx file using Base64 encoding
# by running the following Powershell script to generate the output string:
#
# $pfx_cert = Get-Content '.\SigningCertificate.pfx' -Encoding Byte
# [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($pfx_cert) | Out-File 'SigningCertificate_Encoded.txt'
#
# Open the output file, SigningCertificate_Encoded.txt, and copy the
# string inside. Then, add the string to the repo as a GitHub secret
# and name it "Base64_Encoded_Pfx."
# For more information on how to configure your signing certificate for
# this workflow, refer to https://github.com/microsoft/github-actions-for-desktop-apps#signing
#
# Finally, add the signing certificate password to the repo as a secret and name it "Pfx_Key".
# See "Build the Windows Application Packaging project" below to see how the secret is used.
